## TCMG 476 Group 2 a
I came up with five sections we could do for this: General Class Info, Class Schedule (would be nice to link to separate page), Grading policy, Required Books, and "What we've done so far".

The idea is we each pick one of those (if you've thought of one I didn't list, that's fine too). You can create a new "post" for the information by using ##, for example adding "## Required Books" to the end of index.md will create a new "Required Books" section.

Just a heads up, it's way easier to deal with merge conflicts if you use an IDE. You can get Visual Studio Code for free, and it integrates with GIT. Merge conflicts occur when your code doesn't match the code in the repo, and it will allow you to pick and choose which lines to delete, keep, or add. 

ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH. Make sure to run a git pull command to get the latest code changes before pushing you code to the master branch. That way you won't overwrite anyone's changes.
