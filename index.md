## TCMG 476 Group 2 a
I came up with five sections we could do for this: General Class Info, Class Schedule (would be nice to link to separate page), Grading policy, Required Books, and "What we've done so far".

The idea is we each pick one of those (if you've thought of one I didn't list, that's fine too). You can create a new "post" for the information by using ##, for example adding "## Required Books" to the end of index.md will create a new "Required Books" section.

Just a heads up, it's way easier to deal with merge conflicts if you use an IDE. You can get Visual Studio Code for free, and it integrates with GIT. Merge conflicts occur when your code doesn't match the code in the repo, and it will allow you to pick and choose which lines to delete, keep, or add. 

ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH. Make sure to run a git pull command to get the latest code changes before pushing you code to the master branch. That way you won't overwrite anyone's changes. 

## General Info
### TCMG 476 - Technical Network Capstone
Class: Tuesday/Thursday 11:10-12:25 EDCT 616
Lab: Thursday 12:45-3:30 EDCT 616

### Course Description and Prerequisites 
### Course Objectives
Upon completion of the course, students will have a basic understanding 
of the concepts and practices behind the DevOps model of IT service 
delivery. This includes: classifying types of work within an IT unit; 
systems automation and infrastructure as code; continuous 
integration/delivery of software; and the importance of communication 
and culture within an IT group. Additionally, students will have 
acquired hands-on experience with a variety of tools commonly used in 
DevOps environments, such as version control systems, virtual machines 
and containerization systems, infrastructure automation tools, and 
systems monitoring and reporting tools. The course will provide the 
opportunity to work in teams to deliver modern IT services, and 
experience the DevOps model of service delivery from the inside.
